# Hola-Mundo

My first repository on Github

I like animals, reading and listening to music in English

My favourite bands are Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters and Nirvana

One of my favorite languages is Python because of the amount of amazing things it allows you to do (data science, IA, machine learning and others)
